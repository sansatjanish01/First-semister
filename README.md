## Practicals Overview

In this repository, you'll find practical exercises and assignments related to various subjects I'm studying in my first semester. 
Each practical is organized in its own directory with code and documentation, where applicable.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x or above: You can download Python from the official website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- MySQL: Ensure you have MySQL installed on your system. You should also have access to the MySQL command line prompt.

- Development Environment: You can choose to work with a code editor such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm to run and test the practical exercises.

For specific setup instructions, please refer to the documentation within each practical's directory.
